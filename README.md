MyOOS is an open source community project. The goals are a particularly high degree of adaptability, speed and high performance. The shopbuilding system should be equipped with all basic functions for online sales, ordering, payment, statistics and administration.

The product database is to be maintained online at any time. This ensures that customers are always presented with the latest online offers.

A strong modularization of the system should help inexperienced users to quickly create new areas of a website.

With MyOOS you work customer-oriented.
